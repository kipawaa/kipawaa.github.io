            <p>This project is the newest (and most complete) incarnation of a series of n-body simulators that I've written over the last few years. This project allows simulation of a number of "bodies" (planets, moons, asteroids etc) to be simulated with randomized starting positions, masses and trajectories (in 2D). Simulation software of this style is what first inspired me to begin programming, and I hope that over the next few years I'm able to step further into simulation software to work on fluid dynamics and other interesting phenomena!</p>
