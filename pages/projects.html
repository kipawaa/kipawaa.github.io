            <h3><a href = "https://github.com/kipawaa/N-Body" target = "_blank">Python N-Body Simulator</a></h3>
            <p>
                This project is the newest (and most complete) incarnation of a series of n-body simulators that I've written over the last few years. This project allows simulation of a number of "bodies" (planets, moons, asteroids etc) to be simulated with randomized starting positions, masses and trajectories (in 2D). Simulation software of this style is what first inspired me to begin programming, and I hope that over the next few years I'm able to step further into simulation software to work on fluid dynamics and other interesting phenomena!

            <h3><a href = "https://github.com/kipawaa/Perlin-Noise" target = "_blank">Perlin Noise Generator</a></h3>
            <p>
                This project generates perlin noise, a type of randomized noise that appears very natural. Perlin noise was originally developed for use in the movie "Tron," and Ken Perlin won an Academy Award for his invention.<br>
                I apply his findings here to generate a smooth and "natural" looking 2D photo. Really, this does very little on its own, but can be used in other projects for terrain generation, texturing and many other cool things!

            <h3><a href = "https://github.com/kipawaa/Little-Projects" target = "_blank">Little Projects</a></h3>
            <p>
                This is a repository on github that contains all of my smaller projects! These range from very easy projects (the output of the mobius function) to moderately difficult things (a basic calculator that can perform operations in the correct order).
                Eventually I plan on having a page on this website with a bunch of the calculators I've created in this repository embedded for public use! But until then, they sit in this repository.
